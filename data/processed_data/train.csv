farewell mother,1.0
the polunsky dungeon should be compared with the death row community as existing not living why do i say this the death row is full of isolated hearts and suppressed minds we are filled with love looking for affection and a way to understand i am a death row resident of the polunsky dungeon why does my heart ache we want pleasure love and satisfaction it the walls of darkness crushed in on me life without meaning is life without purpose but the solace within the polunsky dungeon the unforgiveness within society the church pastors and christians it is terrifying does anyone care or who i am can you feel me people the polunsky dungeon is what i call the pit of hopelessness the terrifying thing is the us is the only place country that is the only civilized country that is free that says it will stop murder and enable justice i ask each of you to lift up your voices to demand an end to the death penalty if we live we live to the lord if we die we die to the lord christ rose again in jesus name bye aunt helen luise joanna and to all the rest of yall you may proceed warden began singing,1.0

i really dont have much to say all i want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses its not that they testified against me the thing is my lawyers would not subpoena anyone so they allowed the state to subpoena them to paint a picture to the jury that my own sister and niece was testifying against me linda is innocent of this i am innocent of this now all you all are seeing in the process a perfect example of ol freaky deaky bill clinton when he signed that antiterrorism law to shorten the appeals this is a conspiracy they used false testimony of a woman that said i had raped her when the test showed that the foreign pubic hair that was found on her body belonged to no one in that room they found a drop of sposmosa in the crotch of her pants that was tied to blood type b my blood type is a now the same woman there they brought to testify against this murder case that woman was under indictment for possession of methamphetamine delivery of methamphetamine she could have gotten out of both of those cases yet she swore under oath that she had never been in trouble with the law and none of that mattered so what does that make this great state a very highpriced prostitute that sells itself called justice to the highest bidder i am being charged under article of the texas penal code of murder with the promise of remuneration that means they got to have three people the one that paid the one that killed and the deceased and the alleged remunerator is out on the streets so how come im being executed today without a remunerator this is a great american justice so if you dont think they wont believe me they will aint no telling who gonna be next thats all i have to say especially for the people of the deceased sims is innocent and so am i so the murder is still not there today you are a witness the state cough bye,1.0

i really dont have much to say all i want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses its not that they testified against me the thing is my lawyers would not subpoena anyone so they allowed the state to subpoena them to paint a picture to the jury that my own sister and niece was testifying against me linda is innocent of this i am innocent of this now all you all are seeing in the process a perfect example of ol freaky deaky bill clinton when he signed that antiterrorism law to shorten the appeals this is a conspiracy they used false testimony of a woman that said i had raped her when the test showed that the foreign pubic hair that was found on her body belonged to no one in that room they found a drop of sposmosa sic in the crotch of her pants that was tied to blood type b my blood type is a now the same woman there they brought to testify against this murder casethat woman was under indictment for possession of methamphetamine delivery of methamphetamine she could have gotten out of both of those cases yet she swore under oath that she had never been in trouble with the law and none of that mattered so what does that make this great state a very highpriced prostitute that sells itself called justice to the highest bidder i am being charged under article of the texas penal code of murder with the promise of remuneration that means they got to have three people the one that paid the one that killed and the deceased and the alleged remunerator is out on the streets so how come im being executed today without a remunerator this is a great american justice so if you dont think they wont believe me they will aint no telling who gonna be next thats all i have to say especially for the people of the deceased mims is innocent and so am i so the murder is still not there today you are a witness the state cough bye,1.0

i want to start out by acknowledging the love that ive had in my family no man in this world has had a better family than me i had the best parents in the world i had the best brothers and sisters in the world ive had the most wonderful life any man could have ever had ive never been more proud of anybody than i have of my daughter and my son ive got no complaints and no regrets about that i love everyone of them and have always been loved all of my life ive never had any doubts about that couple of matters that i want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what i have to say the unites states has gotten to a now where they zero respect for human life my death is just a symptom of a bigger illness at some point the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children the ongoing embargo and sanctions against places like iran and iraq cuba and other places they are not doing anything to change the world but they are harming innocent children thats got to stop at some point perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction were going the end result is it wont matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out we have got to wake up and stop doing that ah one of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out or people are ever going to know whats happening as long as we support a free press out there i see the press struggling to stay existent as a free institution one of the few truly free institutions is the press in texas people like the texas observer and i want to thank them for the job theyve done in keeping me and everybody else informed i hope people out there will support them listen to them and be there for them without it things like this are going to happen and nobody will even know i love all of you i always have i always will i would like to address the state of texas and specially joe price the district attorney who put me here i want to remind mr price of the mistake he made at gene hawthorns trial when he said that gene hawthorn was telling the truth at my trial mr price is a oneeyed hunting dog he in fact is not a oneeyed hunting dog and in fact gene hawthorn lied at my trial everybody knew it im dying tonight based on testimony that all parties me the man who gave the testimony the prosecutor he used knew it was a lie i am hoping somebody will call him to the floor for recent comments hes made in the newspaper its bad enough that a prosecutor can take truth and spin on it and try to redoctor it but when they actually make facts up and present to the public as trials evidence that goes beyond fail thats completely unforgivable and i hope somebody makes mr price account for or explain the tennis shoes he is talking about that put me here im still completely lost on that and im hoping that somebody will go back and verify the trial record and make him accountable for lying to the public and the press that way thats really all i have to say except that i love my family and nobody nobody has got a better family than me i love you booger bear i love doodle bug too dont let them ever forget me ill never forget them ill see you on the other side okay bye bye debbie bye bro bye booger bear father mike father walsh love you all thats all sir,1.0
