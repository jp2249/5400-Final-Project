# 5400-Final-Project
The Final Group Project for DSAN 5400

Team Members:
- Jeffrey Pinarchick
- Tyler McCormick
- Younghoon Kim
- Sam Gold
- Nikhil Poluri

## Project Structure & Setup
- [ ] Initialize with `pyproject.toml` (not setup.py)
- [ ] Create `environment.yml` file with all dependencies
- [ ] Set up proper directory structure (src/, tests/, data/, docs/, etc.)

## README Documentation
- [✅] List full names of all team members
- [ ] Project aim and research question
- [ ] Installation instructions
- [ ] Usage examples with code snippets
- [ ] Architecture diagram (created with draw.io or similar)
- [ ] Data download/access instructions
- [ ] Dependencies and environment setup guide

## Data Management
- [ ] Set up data storage (GitHub LFS or Google drive link)
- [✅] Create data download script if possible
- [✅] Implement data preprocessing pipeline
- [✅] Store preprocessed data in folder
- [ ] Document data sources and preprocessing steps
- [ ] NO data pushed to GitHub

## Code Implementation
- [ ] Design OOP (classes for model, preprocessing, evaluation, etc.)
- [ ] Implement sentiment analysis model(s)
- [ ] Add comments to all functions, methods, and classes
- [ ] Implement logging at key points (data loading, training, evaluation)
- [ ] Follow PEP 8 standards using pylint (clean structue)

## Testing Suite
- [ ] Create `tests/` directory with pytest structure
- [ ] Set separate test dataset
- [ ] Write tests for model components
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass

## Sentiment Analysis Specific
- [ ] Data loading and text preprocessing (tokenization + cleaning)
- [ ] Embeddings
- [ ] Model implementation (baseline + advanced models)
- [ ] Training pipeline
- [ ] Evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- [ ] Results visualization and analysis

## Final Checks
- [ ] All code runs without errors
- [ ] Results are reproducible from README instructions
- [ ] Code is well-organized and readable
- [ ] All dependencies documented
