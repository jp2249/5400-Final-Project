WILLIAM ROBINSON,October,27,1659,"This is the day of your visitation, wherein the Lord hath visited you.This is the day the Lord is risen in his mighty power, to be avenged on all his adversaries.

Now ye are made manifest; I suffer for Christ in whom I live and in whom I die"
WILLIAM LEDDRA,March,14,1661,"For bearing my testimony for the Lord against deceivers and the deceived, I am brought here to suffer. Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
UNNAMED RINGLEADER,,,1673,"I have been among drawn Swords, flying bullets, roaring cannons, amidst all which, I knew not what Fear meant: but now I have appreciations of the dreadful wrath of God, in the other World, which I am going into, my Soul within me, is amazed at it... I pray God that I may be a warning to you all, and that I may be the last that ever shall suffer after this manner: In the fear of God I warn you to have a care of taking the Lord's name in vain. And have a care of that sin of Drunkenness, for that sin lead[s] to all manner of sins and wickedness... as I am a dying man, and to appear before that Lord within a few minutes that you may take notice of what I say to you..."
THOMAS LUTHERLAND,February,23,1692,"I had rather go to an Ale-house than to any Church. Pray Young People take warning by my shameful end: keep the Sabbath truly.... I have had great Oppression upon my Spirit since I was in this prison and I thought I should never repent or confess, until Almighty God softened my hard heart and gave me grace to repent. I beg all good people to joyn in prayers with me, I have great need of your prayers."
SARAH GOOD,July,19,1692,"I am no more a witch than you are a wizard, and if you take away my life, God will give you blood to drink."
JULIAN,March,22,1733,"And now I have forsaken God, he has forsaken me, and I acknowledge he has been just in leaving me, for that I have gone from bad to worse, till for my sins I am now to die.... whereas I have been charged with and tried for burning my master's barn, I now declare as a dying man that I did not do it.... I acknowledge I deserve to die, and would confess especially my drunkenness and Sabbath-breaking, which have led me to this great Sin for which I now die"
PATIENCE BOSTON,July,24,1735,"How are we condemned by the Covenant of Works, and relieved by the Covenant of Grace"
REV. JOHN URIE,August,29,1741,"In the presence of God, the possessor of heaven and earth, I lift up my hands and solemnly protest I am innocent of what is laid to my charge. I appeal to the great God for my non-knowledge of Hughson, his wife, or the creature that was hanged with them [Peggy Carey, a prostitute]. I never saw them, living, dying, or dead; nor ever had I any knowledge or confederacy with white or black, as to any plot;... and I protest that the witnesses were perjured; I never knew them but at my trial."
WILLIAM WELCH,April,11,1754,"I heartily thank the good Ministers who have frequently visited me, and prayed for me. I heartily forgive my enemies. And I sincerely fly to the Blood of Jesus Christ which is able to atone for my innumerable iniquities and cleanse me from the Pollution of Sin."
HENRY HALBERT,October,19,1765,"I die in the 30th year of my age, and desire all young Men and Children to take warnings by my untimely End. I die a Protestant according to the Principles of the Lutheran Church, desiring the Prayers of all my Spectators and Hearers."
JOSEPH LIGHTLY,November,21,1765,"And as to the Woman who was my reputed Wife, she died with a Lie in her mouth, but I freely forgive those who swore to her false Declarations. I acknowledge myself to have been a notorious Sabbath-breaker, and would warn all young People against that heinous Crime. I ask forgiveness of all Men whom I have... injur'd, and pray they will forgive me, so I hope for Forgiveness of God."
JOSEPH ANDREWS,May,23,1769,"I acknowledge that I had a fair and impartial [trial] and that the Sentence I received was very just. I am now in the 39th year of my Age, and I die an unworthy member of the Church of Rome, I sincerely bewail the errors of my past life, and hope for mercy in the next. I shall conclude with exhorting you to pray for yourselves, and at the same time to petition heaven to have mercy upon my poor soul."
FRANCIS BURDETT PERSONAL,September,10,1773,"The Lord shewed me, that I had nothing in me that could commend me to God... and as I am shortly to die a shameful death, which I brought upon myself, by reason of living so long without God in the world, yet I would die this death, in the condition I am now in, rather than live in this world, to be carnally minded, as usual. I die now to live eternally. Glory be to God for his free grace bestowed on me, vile sinner. I die, though, most unworthy of the title, one of the Israel of God and an heir of glory."
NATHAN HALE,September,22,1776,I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.
THOMAS GROSS,,,1788,"Don't you imagine that men of liberal education are more intriguing, and do more frequently deceive the world then illiterate farmers? And will you not allow that there are as many bad clergymen, in proportion to their number as any other left? As this is my opinion, why should I request their advice or prayers, in preference to other?"
JOSEPH TAYLOR,May,8,1788,"This is the first time since my condemnation that I thought what it was to die. The shock was terrible... what a night of horror was the next night!... [The doctor] perceived that agony of my soul and asked me some questions of the state of my mind... and [I poured] my heart out to him... I had fortunately concealed my real name, that I might return, like the prodigal, to my parents, and live a life devoted to God and their comfort."
ELISHA THOMAS,June,3,1788,"I cannot forget to return my thanks to the Gentlemen and Ladies of the town of Dover, who so humanely petitioned his Excellency and council, for a short respite of my execution-may they enjoy long and uninterrupted happiness here, and may the best of Heaven's blessings await them hereafter. Nor must I neglect the same testimonials of kindness I have received from them during my confinement. I now recommend my soul to the allmerciful Creator of all Worlds and all Creatures, most ardently imploring the forgiveness, of may manifold transgressions, and that the redeemer would most graciously receive me to the arms of his everlasting mercy, when I leave the world."
RACHEL WALL,October,8,1789,"I likewise return my hearty thanks to the several Ministers of the town who have attended be [sic] since I have been under sentence: also to a number of other kind friends, for the care they have shewn to me both for soul and body... may God reward them all for their kindness to me. And now, into the hands of Almighty God I commit my soul, relying on his mercy, through the merits and mediation of my Redeemer, and die an unworthy member of the Presbyterian Church, in the 29th year of my age."
SAMUEL FROST,October,31,1793,"I declare that I ever had a great aversion to stealing and telling lies, and think them to be great crimes. I always meant to tell truth, and never stole, except taking a few apples from orchards may be called so."
EDMUND FORTIS,September,25,1794,"And now, as a dying man, I recommend to the charity of Christian neighbors, my distressed wife Lydia, who I leave with two small children, destitute of everything to help themselves with, and she big with child. And I desire the prayers of all good people to God for them and myself."
ABRAHAM JOHNSTONE,July,8,1797,"I most solemnly declare with my dying breath... that I am innocent, and unknowing to the death ofThomas Read the Guinea, Negro [that I die for].... And now having settled my worldly affairs I shall close and prepare to depart in peace. I've kissed this paperand bid it convey the kiss to you my love: and now my dear Sally, I bid you-oh heavens! I bid you my dear wife! Not the Farewell of a day, month, nor year-but an eternal farewell-I earnestly beg your prayers for me and may God protect, preserve, prosper, and bless you, is the dying prayer of your dotingly fond husband..."
STEPHEN SMITH,October,12,1797,"When I think how I have sinned against the great God, my heart breaks and tears run from my eyes... I forgive every body, and hope that God will have mercy on me. Now in the 28th year of my age, I commit my spirit in to the hands of a merciful... God and hope he will receive me for his great mercy's sake. I die in peace with all mankind, and beg that all people will take warning by my awful end."
JEREBOAM O. BEAUCHAMP,July,7,1826,"Your husband is dying happy! For you I lived, for you I die! I hear you groan! I hope you may yet be recovered! If you are, live till it is God's will to take you, and prepare to meet me in a better world!"
NAT TURNER,November,11,1831,It's in God's hands now.
JOHN STONE,July,10,1840,"I swear to you, sheriff, I'm an innocent man. I have never been to the Thompson house, and I never saw Mrs. Thompson on the day that she was murdered. I believe that there were two of them-two men-who did the murder that I've been wrongly accused of. Even if I did know their names, I'd swing before I would have their blood upon me."
AARON STOOKEY,September,19,1851,"Lord Jesus, have mercy on my soul. God bless you. I hope I shall be better off. My dear fellow citizens—I now stand here before you to die, and I hope and believe my soul will be saved, I trust my God has forgiven me. You must all beware of Rum; for rum has been the cause of placing me here to meet this awful fate. I warn you all not to touch the intoxicating bowl, for it will eventually get the advantage of you all. I am sorry to die under the gallows but the laws must be carried out, and die I must, remember what I say, Rum has done it all, and I hope all who are here will be taking warning by it. God bless you all, may God have mercy on my soul, and receive me into his kingdom. Good-by, God bless you and my friends."
JAMES WILSON,November,28,1851,"Here we go, pals, 'round and 'round."
CREED TURNER,December,4,1851,I committed the deed and now I'm paying for it. If I had to do it over again I would. I leave my written words for you all to read.
OTTO GRUNZIG,February,27,1852,"Mr. Sheriff, you are a good man, and I have nothing to say, except that I protest my innocence. In my last dying words, I say I am innocent! I am innocent! I am innocent! Justice in this country is bad. I was not guilty, and the Jury did wrong in convicting me."
WILLIAM B. SHEPPARD,July,28,1854,I feel like an innocent man.
WILLIAM H. LIPSEY,November,3,1854,"Make the time as short as you can, for I am fainting."
STEPHEN SHORT,January,19,1855,"I want all of you to take warning by me. See what whisky and bad women have brought me to. I have been to a good many hanging scrapes myself, and thought it was great fun, but I never thought I'd be hung myself.This is the work of Capt. Whisky. I am willing to die for the life of the man that I took. Talk of pleasure-I have tried all kinds of it, about shanties drunk, and everywhere else, but I have had more real pleasure up in that old jail, than ever before in all my life; and chains on my legsbig, heavy chains at that. I just took off this old coat, and whipped Satan clean out, fair. I've made my election sure, I think. Yes, sir, I think my election is sure."
JEREMIAH V. CRAINE,October,26,1855,"Susan, receive me; I will soon be with you."
DANFORTH HARTSON,July,15,1857,"For God's sake, don't do that again."
ALBERT STAUB,April,20,1858,"I wish to speak a few words to my German countrymen. You all see what the temptings ofthe devil have brought me to, and I wish you to be warned by my fate. Keep away from bad company, and let liquor alone. Do not covet the money of others, and do not let your wish for money lead you into crime. I implore you to get religion, to go to church, and to pray to God, for there is more rejoicing in Heaven over one sinner who repents than ninety-nine that need no repentance. Be warned by me, and do not commit sin. Amen."
JOHN BROWN,December,2,1859,"No, I am ready at any time; but do not keep me needlessly waiting."
ANN BILANSKI,March,23,1860,"Don't let a crowd see me. I am willing to meet my God, but I don't want to have a crowd see me die. I die without having any mercy shown on me, or justice. I die for the good of my soul and not for murder. Your courts of justice are not courts ofjustice-but I will yet get justice, in heaven."
JOHN CRUMMINS,March,30,1860,"I feel deeply grateful to the people of New York and to all present who have had anything to do with me, for the sympathy they have expressed and the kindness they have extended toward me, and I ask God to bless and reward you all for your great attention. I feel sorry for the crime I have committed, but it was done under the influence of passion and without a design to do murder. I hope my wife and children will be taken care of by my friends, and that my disgrace will not fall upon them.I hope, too, that McHenry's wife and children will be looked to by my friends. I trust to receive the mercy of the Almighty."
HDAINYANKA,December,24,1862,"You have deceived me. You told me that if we followed the advice of General Sibley, and gave ourselves up to the whites, all would be well; no innocent man would be injured. I have not killed, wounded or injured a white man, or any white persons. I have not participated in the plunder of their property; and yet to-day I am set apart for execution, and must die in a few days, while men who are guilty will remain in prison. My wife is your daughter, my children are your grandchildren. I leave them all in your care and under your protection. Do not let them suffer; and when my children are grown up, let them know that their father died because he followed the advice of his chief, and without having the blood of a white man to answer for to the Great Spirit."
HIRAM REYNOLDS,August,17,1863,"I see it now, it is all bright."
THOMAS R. DAWSON,April,25,1864,"You may break my neck, but you won't break the seal of manhood."
JOHN YATES BEALL,February,24,1865,I protest against the execution of this sentence. It is absolute murder-brutal murder! I die in the defense and service of my country. I beg you to make haste!
MARCELLUS JEROME CLARKE,March,15,1865,"I am a regular Confederate soldier, and have served in the Confederate army four years. I fought under General Buckner at Fort Donelson, and belonged to General Morgan's command when he entered Kentucky. I have assisted, and have taken many prisoners, and have always treated them kindly. I was wounded at Cynthiana and cut from my command. I have been in Kentucky ever since. I could prove that I am a regular Confederate soldier, and I hope to die for the Confederate cause."
MARY SURRATT,July,7,1865,Please don't let me fall.
HENRY WILSON,December,22,1865,"I had made a request not to have my photograph taken, for fear my friends would recognize me. Somebody else made aa request that it should be taken, and Chase [the sheriff] paid more attention to them than to me, and let them try to take it as I came out. You can see what kind of man this Chase is, and if I had a chance I would take his photograph d-d quick. I don't think they got a good one. So my friends will not know it. Perhaps my photograph will be the means of finding out who I am, but I doubt it d-dly. I have nothing more to say, and you may go on as soon as you please, for it is no consolation to me to be kept standing here in the cold."
BARNEY OLWELL,January,22,1866,"I don't know as I've got anything to say; I am going to be hanged, and don't want to make a stump speech."
ROBERT S. DODGE,November,8,1899,"The time will come when my innocence will be proven, and then Bob Dodge will haunt you for his murder."
TOM DULA,May,1,1868,"Gentlemen, do you see this hand? Does it tremble? I never hurt a hair of that girl's head."
GEORGE TRUMAN,May,28,1869,"The sands of a brief existence have nearly run; my eyes are closing forever upon the beauties ofthis lesser world, to open, I hope and trust and pray, upon the splendor of a better. I bid all a last farewell."
JOHN BOYER,April,21,1871,Look at me! I no cry; I no woman; I man. I die brave!
ISSAC M. WEAVER,January,4,1874,I have always wished not to die with my boots on; please pull them off.
MARSHALL MARTIN,January,23,1874,"Gentlemen, I am here to die, but I am an innocent man compared to that woman. She deserves death ten times more than I do."
WILLIAM WRIGHT WHEATLEY,August,13,1875,"My Friends: You are now gazing upon a very unfortunate man, who is called forth to bid a final adieu to this cheating and sinful world. God of infinite mercy have compassion upon a poor sinner and save me from perdition. My friends, I desire to thank all the good people of Montana, and now ask God to bless you all and those dear ones so far away. I am now about to offer up my life. I make this statement to show you how unfortunate I am and as a warning to you all, just as I go to that awful future, to meet my God. May God bless you all. I am ready, God have mercy on my soul."
ALCEE HARRIS ,November,26,1875,I'm going to Jesus.
MARSHALL CRAIN,January,21,1876,I must make a statement in regard to this matter. I feel it my duty to God and to man to do so. I am guilty of killing the two men. My soul is stained with blood and my punishment is just. I hope all will forgive me. I pray God to guide and prosper this country. I am the murderer of William Spence. And George W. Sisney. That is all I have to say.
ISAIAH EVANS,May,10,1878,"I had a square trial. Everything the witnesses said was pretty much true. I felt at the time that I ought to have done it, and afterward I felt I did wrong. I tell you it's a hard thing when a man brings it on himself, but whisky did it."
GEORGE SHERRY,June,21,1878,"I bid you farewell, my sister, likewise to this world of sin. But 'tis hard, 'tis hard, my sister, to part from friends and kin. To be led like a brute to the slaughter, to die by the hangman's hand. To perish like a guilty felon, condemned by the laws of the land."
MARTIN BERGIN,January,16,1879,I have nothing at all to say. I will die like a Game Man. That is all I have to say.
WILLIAM MERRICK,January,29,1879,"I have a great deal I would like to say, but it would not be worth while to say anything. The State of Indiana to-day, in the sight of that Court-house, is doing an unjust thing to one of her citizens. I say, as I have said before to this people and to the world, I am innocent of the charge. When that drop fails and my life goes out, it will be eternal peace. I wish to say no more."
HENRY F. ANDREWS,May,16,1879,Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Don't hang me! I can't die! I'm not ready to die! I don't want to die!
ANDREW TRACY,December,4,1879,I forgive my enemies.
JOHN VANDERPIED,February,25,1881,"All young men take warning and never be guilty of theft, however small, because they might deserve the small penalty I am about to suffer. I have five minutes to live. I can think of Heaven in that time.While there is life there is hope."
MATILDA CARTER,January,13,1882,"Folks, hear me, as I'se to be hanged. I'se free from any guilt about Nash Carter. I had a child by another man, but was smart enough to keep my husband from knowing it."
EMELINE MEAKER,March,30,1883,I have got nothing more to say. May God forgive you for murdering me. You are about to hang an innocent woman-innocent as the man that stands there.
HENRY DICKERSON,September,7,1883,"You young saints and sinners, take warning and let whisky alone. It was whisky that brought me here. I did not kill the man, it was whisky; but I am come here now, and God has pardoned me. My way is clear before me. I have nearly come up, and am now pulling myself into the light of glory.... I advise all you saints and sinners not to fool too much with whisky. Here I am, a hardworking man, brought here by whisky. Steele told me in the spirit that if could he come and speak for me he would say a good word for me. I trust to meet you all with my Jesus.... God bless you all."
MARGARET HARRIS,October,19,1883,"I am going to tell the truth before God. I am innocent of the charge. I did not poison Leia Lewis, and I hope to meet her in heaven. My kin people brought me to this, and I want them to pray to meet me in heaven. I have heard they said hanging was too good for me, that I ought to be burned. Farewell all, I am going to die. I hope this poor man will be released, as he is innocent before God."
ROBERT MARTIN,January,3,1884,"I am almost sorry you woke me up. I was having pleasant dreams. No! I can't tell you what they were, because I can't recall them. I only know that I was in a most delightful frame of mind."
EDWARD RECTOR,January,4,1884,"Where is my little boy? Look at me, my son, and take warning."
JOHN OWENS,March,5,1886,What time is it? I wish you'd hurry up. I want to get to hell in time for dinner.
ALLEN J. ADAMS,April,16,1886,"None of your business. What in the _ do you want to take a man's life in this way for, you __ cutthroats. Hurry up, old man, or Clark will want another drink of whisky. If you don't look out, I may fall through and sue the city for damages."
JOHN THOMAS ROSS,September,9,1887,"Gentlemen, one and all, I am about to die for a crime of which I am guilty and I am perfectly willing to go. I have nothing to regret, but I am sorry that I, John Thomas Ross, have to pay it all. As Marshall Frey knows, there are others who are as much guilty as I am. I am glad I have been brought to this and I am thankful to God for bringing me here. I have no hard feelings against anyone. Had not God stopped me in my bad career I might never have gotten here. I am going where there is no trouble or sighing and where I will have rest forever. Let me go. Lord Jesus, remember me."
ADOLPH FISCHER,November,11,1887,This is the happiest day of my life.
AUGUST SPIES,November,11,1887,The time will come when our silence will be more powerful than the voices you strangle today.
GEORGE ENGEL,November,11,1887,Hurrah for anarchy!
ALBERT PARSONS,November,11,1887,"May I be allowed to speak? Oh, men of America! May I be allowed the privilege of speech even at the last moment? Harken to the voice of the people"
JOSE RAMIREZ,December,2,1887,"Good-by for all my gentlemens [sic], good-by. I am going to die like a man; isn't that so gentlemen?"
JOHN PATRICK HART,February,10,1888,"I wish you all a restful conscience and a useful life on this life on this earth. I hope when you come through this door you will bring some little child that has no father and mother on this earth for protection. That is all I have to say on this earth, Good-bye."
PIERRE PAUL,December,19,1890,"I killed the men. I do not regret [it], but they tell me it was wrong. If so, I am sorry. You see how I am here. Try and help my people. If so, tell them how I died, and warn them not to do as I did, or they may die, as I have to die. Be kind to my people and see that they do not want. I am glad you come and I thank you for being here and for what you have done for me. See that I am buried with my people."
JAMES M. EUBANKSs,January,19,1891,"Oh, Jesus, I give myself to Thee; Thy will be done. I hope that this will be a warning to others."
CHARLES WALL,March,8,1892,"I have this to say: That I know nothing about the murder. The people bore false witness against me. I hired Mr. Platt to defend me and told him all I knew, but he turned against me and went over to the other side. That is the reason I am on the scaffold to-day. If I did the deed and knew what I was doing, I ought to be hanged for it, but I did not know what I was doing."
WALTER HOLMES,February,3,1893,"I only wish to say that the statement I have made about the crime with which I stand charged is true. I must say that since I have been here, no Protestant minister has come near me. When the priests came, they were kind to me, and I can only say that I die happy and a Catholic. That is all."
PATRICK EUGENE PRENDERGAST,July,13,1894,I had no malice against anyone.
CHIEF CHA NOPA UHAH,December,28,1894,"My heart is not bad.... I did not kill the cowboys; the Indian boys [White Faced Horse, Fights With, Two Two, and First Eagle] killed them. I have killed many Indians, but never killed a white man; I never pulled a gun on a white man. The great father and the men under him should talk to me and I would show them I am innocent. The white men are going to kill me for something I haven't done. I am a great chief myself. I have always been a friend of the white man. The white men will find out sometime that I am innocent and then they will be sorry they killed me. The great father will be sorry, too, and he will be ashamed. My people will be ashamed, too. My heart is straight and I like everybody. God made all hearts the same. My heart is the same as the white man's. If I had not been innocent I would not have come up here so good when they wanted me. They know I am innocent or they would not let me go around here. My heart knows I am not guilty and I am happy. I am not afraid to die. I was taught that if I raised my hands to God and told a lie that God would kill me that day. I never told a lie in my life."
ANTHONY AZOFF,June,7,1895,"Good-bye, boys. Here goes a brave man!"
CLAYBERG PUGH,July,1,1895,"No, let her go. Tighten her up, old son, tighten her up!"
JOSEPH CADOTTE,December,27,1895,"Gentlemen, it was said that I killed Richards over a girl. That is not so. It was pure passion. I had thought the man wanted to take everything away from me and now I am to pay for his life. Good-bye."
HENRY FOSTER,January,24,1896,"Gentlemen: I did the deed. I killed George Wells, and I do not want any one to suffer for it. But the Lord has forgiven me of all my crimes. All I have to say is, I did not want to die. This may be a lesson to some one. I see a lot of you around here who may have young boys coming up, and this may prevent them from coming where I am today."
HERMAN WEBSTER MUDGETT,May,7,1896,"Gentlemen, I have very few words to say. In fact, I would make no remarks at this time except that by not speaking I would appear to acquiesce in my execution. I only wish to say that the extent of my wrong-doing in taking human life consisted in the death of two women, they having died at my hands as the result of criminal operations. I wish to also state here, so that there can be no chance of misunderstanding hereafter, that I am not guilty of taking the lives of any of the Pitezel familythe three children and Benjamin, the father-of whose death I was convicted, and for which I am to-day to be hanged. That is all I have to say."
LOVETT BROOKINS,April,16,1897,"My friends, I can't leave without saying something. You never can tell my feelings as I stand before you. It is sad indeed. Bad women are the cause of my being in this position. I am safe, as Christ Jesus has pardoned my sins. I soon will be somewhere in God's kingdom. Reflect before you get mad, and you will never commit crime. Just think of it! I am to be executed in the bloom of youth and good health! I committed the crime, and I am sorry. If I could only call it back! With all due respect to women, I must say they have brought me to ruin. She deceived me and robbed me of my character and money. I was over persuaded by this woman. She had me in her power and worked her way in my heart, so that I felt I had rather be dead than alive. She is lying in the cold, silent grave, and tomorrow I also will be numbered with the dead. My soul will then be at rest. I implore you all to abstain from evil habits. Especially beware of bad women. No, I am through."
HARVEY ALLENDER,December,10,1897,"The poor young fellow I killed and the girl I loved and also killed, were victims of a moment's passion. I only wish that I could bring them back to life. The scaffold has no terrors for me. I rather welcome it. A man can only die once. My time has come and I am content with it."
HIRAM HALL,April,13,1899,"On the morning of August 18, 1897, Ida, my wife, took a bucket and started to the well. My mother ran to me and said, ""Now, Hiram, is your time."" I took another bucket and followed her. We came to the well, and Ida stooped down to dip her bucket of water. I threw my weight against her and pushed her into the well. She caught with her hands and feet on the sides of the well. As she clung there, looking up into my face with such a pleading, pitiful face, I thought that surely I had no heart at all, for such pleading would have melted a heart of stone. I stooped down, picked up a large stone, and struck her on the head with all my strength. She quivered for a moment and then dropped lifeless into the water. I did not wait to see if she sank, but went immediately to the house. In a minute or two mother came running into the house and told me that Ida was trying to get out, and that she could do nothing. I went back to the well and found her floating on the top of the water, apparently lifeless. I took a plank and struck her on the head and face several times; then pushed her under the water with the plank and held it on her a few seconds. Then she sank."
WILLIAM WASCO,January,9,1900,"Good-by, people. I gladly give my life for my sweetheart. I loved her."
JOAQUIN ESLABE,April,23,1900,"I am sorry for killing Gates. I was wrong. I don't know if I am forgiven. I may have to suffer in the next world. The priest tells me so, perhaps, but I am as sorry as I can be for it."
BENJAMIN SNELL,June,29,1900,"Oh, I'll smother with that on. I've got electricity in my head now."
"THOMAS E. ""BLACK JACK"" KETCHUM",April,26,1901,Goodbye. Please dig my grave very deep. Let her go!
GEORGE DOLINSKI,October,11,1901,If I only knew my family would not be in want I could die in peace.
CHARLES FRANCIS WOODWARD,March,28,1902,"Boys, let me kneel and pray. I want to pray for all of you and send a message to my blessed little wife. I love her dearly and want you to tell her that I pray that you will have the papers print it. I pray for you, Charles Ricker, and for all of you. I never had a grudge against Sheriff Ricker; never in God's world. I never meant to shoot him. For God's sake don't choke me to death"

EDWARD DELEHANTE,December,6,1912,"Gentlemen, I presume you have come here to witness the execution of a murderer but while that is the word for my crime, I am not a murderer at heart. But the law requires my execution, and I am ready."
JOHN GOODWIN,May,13,1913,"Four perjurers sent me to this. I did not have a fair trial. I am a Socialist and would rather die than live under the present oligarchy. It was a long, hard fight I made, but I lost. I surrender, but am not conquered. I will take my medicine. There have been none in my family who would not take his medicine."
ROSWELL C. F. SMITH,February,13,1915,"I will raise mine eye unto the hills, whence cometh my help..."
HARRISON GIBSON,February,16,1917,They can't kill a smile!
EDWARD BLACKIE WHEED,February,15,1918,I shouldn't have killed those bank messengers. Maybe my death on the gallows will even the score.

NICHOLAS VIANA,December,10,1920,"My last wish is that Sam Cardinella hang, too. He's responsible for me being here. He headed the gang. It is sweet to die for a mother, sister and a brother. I forgive all who have done anything against me. I want to thank the sheriff and the jailer and all who have been good..."
EDWARD J. BRISLANE,February,11,1921,"I am against this horrible form of murder by the state, but I would rather be standing here for the crime that, so help me God, I never remember committing, than to be sitting down there eagerly waiting to see a man die. Let the state of Illinois take shame upon itself. Goodbye."
GROVER CLEVELAND REDDING,June,24,1921,"I have something to say, but not at this time."
EUGENE WEEKS,September,15,1922,They won't hurt my feelings when they hang me. It is nothing to dread.
GEORGE DONNELLY,February,23,1923,Dope started me on my way. I've seen the time I'd give my life for the stuff. Now I'm giving it away any way.
CHARLES BIRGER,April,19,1928,"Beautiful world... I've forgiven everybody.... I haven't a thing to say. Turn'er loose.... Goodbye, Doc....You're a wonderful old boy. I haven't got a thing against anybody in the world. I forgive everybody. I can do that because of this wonderful Jewish rabbi. That's all. Goodbye."
EDGAR LAPIERRE,February,15,1929,"...my heart be removed from my remains and that it be sent to N. M.Wheatley. So that he may gaze upon the heart of a man who, through his cowardice, caused the ignoble death of a man better then himself."

JOHNNY JONES,March,16,1934,I want to warn others of my race. I wish some of them were here to see how we go. It's awful.
GEORGE CRINER,October,16,1935,"It is just this, I am sorry for what I have done. Although I am not sorry that I am leaving this world because I feel I am going to something better. I hope you will always pray through life because you don't know what way you will be called out. A few minutes before this happened if anyone had told me that I would be here, I would have said they were crazy. But remember, anything can happen to anybody. You can walk out on the street and die of heart trouble. Or you can go out on the street and get run over. I think that will be all."
DOUGLAS VAN VLACK,December,9,1937,I have a right to choose the way I die!

WALTER BEYER,July,10,1945,I can't see why this is being done to me.
BARTON KAY KIRKHAM,June,7,1958,"There was so much hate in me then and it keeps building up and there was no release for it and I did not care what happened. The Doctors said I felt justified when I killed those people and they are right. I did. It was revenge I was after. The love that I was denied because my parents spent too much time doing church work and they still do, and forcing me to stay home and lead the life they wanted me to live. I got my revenge and I am not sorry now and never will be.... I've had enough of it, I want to die. I'm fed up with it all. I did kill those people to hurt my parents and their good standing in the church. Who failed me? It was not only my parents but myself and a lot of others. My life is a real mess now and I will be glad when it is all over with."
RICHARD EUGENE HICKOCK,April,14,1965,I don't have any hard feelings. You're sending me to a better place.
PERRY EDWARD SMITH,April,14,1965,I think it's a hell of a thing that a life has to be taken in this manner. I think capital punishment is legally and morally wrong.
WESTLEY DODD,January,5,1993,"I was asked by somebody, I don't remember who, if there was any way sex offenders could be stopped. I said no. I was wrong. I said there was no hope, no peace. There is peace. There is hope. I found both in the Lord Jesus Christ."
JEAN BAPTISTE NOYAN,October,25,1769,With my comrades I fought! With them I die!
CHIEF ANTONIO GARRA,January,16,1852,"Gentlemen, I ask your pardon for all my offenses, and expect yours in return."
WILLIAM W. LUNT,December,1,1862,"I'm about to suffer death, which punishment I am willing to bear for a warning to others which may be led astray by bad company. Fellow soldiers, you should take warning by me and keep out of bad company, and shun everything that is bad. Keep good company, and you will be respected by your worst enemies. Oh! may God bless the officers of the Forty-Seventh New York Regiment for the kindness they have shown me, a wicked sinner. They have done everything that was in their power, and they brought me tracts to read and religious papers that led me the right road to my Savior. Oh! may God help and sustain them through the perils of battles, that they may come out victorious in them all, and God speed the time when peace shall once more be, and the friends that is here at war will be going home to their families."
WILLIAM E. ORMSLEY,February,7,1864,"Comrades: I want to acknowledge that I am guilty and that my punishment is just. But I want also that you should know that I did not desert because I lost faith in our cause. I believe we are on the right side, and I think it will succeed. But take warning from my example, and whatever comes do not desert the old flag for which I am proud to die."

FREDERICK HOPT,August,11,1887,"Gentleman, I have come to meet my fate. Had justice been done at my first trial, I would not be here today for this purpose. I have no ill-will toward any man living, and am prepared and ready to meet my God."
ENOCH DAVIS,September,14,1894,"Boys, I am told that you want to see me die game. That's just the way I am going to die. I shall die like a man for I am a man amongst men."

PETER MORTENSEN,November,20,1903,"To this world I want to say, and I swear by the heavens above, by the earth beneath and by all that I hold near and dear on earth, that I am not guilty of that cowardly murder of my dearest friend. I ask, therefore, no man's pardon for aught that I have done in life. I am confident that my life is an example to most people. I have nothing to say except that I am innocent."
FRANK ROSE,April,22,1904,"So long, fellows."

GEORGE GARDNER,August,31,1923,"Forgiveness. The most bitter of my friends are forgiven. I am ready to go, and the day of reckoning will come. That cannot be avoided. If only I could make them understand, but I can't. May the Almighty God protect all that I leave behind and see that even to my enemies no harm shall befall."
OMER R. WOODS,January,18,1924,"I have tried the best I could to give the exact truth to the pardon board in every particular. I believe-and it is my dying statement-that Vadney was the smaller of the two robbers. I am as innocent today as the day my mother gave me birth. I am prepared to meet my maker in peace. My conscience is clear and undisturbed. I have never in my life harmed my wife or any other human being, to my knowledge. I consider that the board of pardons held one ideathat I am guilty. They consider me a condemned man and would not believe me although I spoke as near the truth as I could. I call upon God as a witness to what I say. I forgive all. I shall soon see God and it shall be in perfect peace. I will see my wife-she will meet me with outstretched arms. She knows I never harmed her but I was always kind and good, not only to her but to everyone. My brothers have been loyal and done everything they could, but they apparently could not change the decree. I do not think the Supreme Court treated me right. They had the one idea that I was guilty. I am not. In a few minutes I will be ushered into eternity where all secrets are known. Over there they will judge me and they will say I am innocent."
HENRY C. HETT,February,20,1925,"I shall not feel that I have died in vain if my passing will show to you that there is only one road that leads to happiness and that is the straight and narrow path of honesty, virtue, and truth. Please do not treat this as only the dying admonition of a fellow convict. Its observance by you will mean to me that my sacrifice may prove your salvation."
EDWARD MCGOWAN,February,5,1926,"Ere this will have been handed to and read by you, my soul will have been wafted before its Maker. My last wish and desire on this earth will be realized when I am able to have published my closing words in the form of advice to the youth of the nation. To you I say obey your parents, seek the advice of your elders, and live an honest and clean life with thoughts of brighter and cleaner things, at all times seek the finer things in life, and by all means obey the teachings of God and be able through these teachings to receive ultimate celestial glory."

JOHN DEERING,October,31,1938,"When I was a kid raising hell everyone told me I'd end up on the gallows, so I thought I'd fool them. Also,there's an old saying I like: ""Live by the sword and die by the sword."""
ROBERT WALTER AVERY,February,5,1943,It's getting light.What's holding those fellows up?
"EDWARD DONALD ""EDDIE"" SLOVIK",January,31,1945,Don't worry about me. I'm okay. They're not shooting me for deserting the United States Army-thousands of guys have done that. They're shooting me for bread I stole when I was 12 years old.

JOHN ALBERT TAYLOR,January,26,1996,"I would like to say for my family and my friends, as the poem was written, ""Remember me, but let me go."""
ROBERT BUCHANAN,July,1,1895,"Warden, these are probably my last words, and I want you to be in a position to speak with certainty concerning any confession which in the future you may hear I have made. I want to say to you now that I am entirely innocent of the crime for which I am about to be executed. There was no more morphine in that woman as administered by me than there is in you at this moment. I suppose I am not the first innocent man to be executed."
BARTHOLOMEW SHEA,February,11,1896,"On the verge of death I desire to say that I do not think I had a fair trial. Extraordinary means were taken to convict me, and testimony given by Mr. Lansing was absolutely untrue. I am sorry for Ross' family, and for the gloom it has cast over them, but I did not go to the polls on election day to shoot Robert Ross, and had no intention of injuring him. I die for a crime I did not commit. I am an innocent man. I bid you all farewell. I am innocent, Father, innocent."
MARTHA PLACE,March,20,1899,God help me.

FRANK HENRY BURNESS,June,27,1904,"I deserve to die, and the sooner they put an end to my troubles the better. I've got an uncontrollable temper, and if released would only commit more violent crimes. I'd kill a man for 5 cents as quick as for anything else."

HOWARD BAKER,December,9,1920,"If I've got to leave this good old Earth, I want to make a statement before I go. I'm feeling all right, but it's over others I'm worrying."
BEN RICHARDSON,February,2,1923,Don't be afraid of me. I would as soon have you do it as anyone.

BARTOLOMEO VANZETTI,August,23,1927,"I wish to say to you that I am innocent. I have never done a crime, some sins, but never any crime. I thank you for everything you have done for me. I am innocent of all crime, not only this one, but of all, all. I am an innocent man. I wish to forgive some people for what they are doing to me."
GEORGE APPEL,August,9,1928,"I am innocent of the killing of that cop. I committed other crimes and I lay that to evil companions. But I didn't kill the cop. I wouldn't kill one. Didn't I try to save the life of one? Graham was one, wasn't he, and didn't I try to prove him innocent?"
DANIEL J. GRAHAM JR.,August,9,1928,"I am innocent. I was arrested for grand larceny and for assault on a previous occasion, but I was found innocent of those charges. I went into the army during the World War when I was only 15. This is the reward."
AUGUST VOGEL,May,9,1930,"I don't want to die with a lie on my lips. I lied when I said this killing was a result of gin and anger. I deliberately planned a robbery. I was watching for anybody worth robbing. I had a revolver and an automobile. I know how to handle revolvers, but this was the first time I had ever handled an automatic. As I pressed it against the man and told him to put his hands up, the gun went off, although, so help me God, I didn't mean to shoot."
JOSEPH CALABRESE,December,29,1930,Father Mac is the greatest man who ever lived.
WILLIE GREEN,December,11,1931,"O my God, I am sorry for having offended thee."
FRANK BELL,January,8,1932,"Frank Bell, having been baptized, made confession and received communion. He felt resigned to God's holy will and stated that he was perfectly sure that Leo Brothers is innocent of the crime he is charged with. The reason I make this statement is because I would have appeared at Brothers' trial if the Supreme Court should have given him a new one. I regret that the Supreme Court did not grant a decision before [it was] too late for me to act. I made a statement contradicting my testimony given to officials denying I had anything to do with the Lingle murder. My first statement which I made was the true facts pertaining to the Lingle case."
"FRANCIS ""TWO-GUN"" CROWLEY",January,21,1932,I don't mind it. My love to mother and tell Mrs. Lawes I appreciate all she did for me.

Push the button!"
MORRIS COHEN,October,13,1933,"It looks pretty dark, but ifI have to, I guess I can take my medicine."
EARL QUINN,November,24,1933,"I don't hold it against all you folks because you have condemned me without a fair trial. I don't even hold it against the jury. Ignorance is not the fault of the ignorant. I don't even have any malice for the courts, although they defied all laws in affirming my case. I forgive all of you. You loved the girls. You let your desire for revenge overshadow your sense of justice."
HARVEY EDWARDS,March,2,1934,I want to die this way. I can't stand the thought of going to the chair. Don't-please don't-try to save me for that.
JOHN SCHECK,April,20,1934,"Please smile and laugh, for that's all you now can do. If you'll be happy I'll be happy, too. I have only myself to blame... The thought never occurred to anyone during the trial to show the circumstances of John Scheck as a mere boy who was lured and tempted into the life of crime because of his intense devotion to his parents and to his home that they were about to be deprived of as victims of a nationwide economic depression...So John Scheck plotted the escape which resulted in failure and the unfortunate death of a policeman. ... As a boy, John Scheck is fighting a battle to live in grief and sorrow for a mistake that is very close to him."
SAMUEL FERACI,August,9,1934,"I want to thank you, gentlemen. I go to die, but I am innocent. That is all I can say. I wish you good luck-all of you-all your life."
ANNA ANTONIO,August,9,1934,I don't care what you do to me. I am not afraid to die. I have nothing on my conscience. I never killed any one.
FRED BLINK,April,23,1935,I wish I had Corrick and Wynn on my laр.

EVA COO,June,27,1935,"If I have to die, I will die innocent. I never killed Harry Wright or anyone else."
BRUNO RICHARD HAUPTMANN,April,3,1936,"I am glad that my life in a world which has not understood me has ended. Soon I will be at home with my Lord, so I am dying an innocent man. Should, however, my death serve for the purpose of abolishing capital punishment-such a punishment being arrived at only by circumstantial evidence-I feel that my death has not been in vain. I am at peace with God. I repeat, I protest my innocence of the crime for which I was convicted. However, I die with no malice or hatred in my heart.The love of Christ has filled my soul and I am happy in Him."

"EDWARD ""PADDY RYAN"" RILEY",June,20,1941,"You never know when. Life is like a deck of cards and we are all the jokers. First it's hearts, then it's diamonds. Next it's clubs, and now it's spades."
BERNARD SAWICKI,January,17,1942,"Dear Mother Speaker, that is, if I may call you that? I would like to express my gratitude for the way you took my message from Father Connolly, and I would also like to thank you for saying the Stations of the Cross for me. I know I'm no good and I hope you forgive me for what I've done to your husband. If I knew then what I know now, this tragedy would never have happened. I know that Mr. Speaker is up there praying for me; I will probably meet him there tonight if God wills it. Please say a prayer for me. I need it. May I always be your friend."
RICHARD QUIRIN,August,8,1942,"These are the last lines I can write to you. I should like to tell you that I have always loved you and that I came here to make a better life for you, my dear ones. But unfortunately, God willed it otherwise....Tell Kappe or one of his people that George Dasch and Peter Burger betrayed us. Begin a new life and think of me often."
EDDIE KERLING,August,8,1942,"Marie, my wife-I am with you to the last minute! This will help me to take it as a German! Even the heaven out there is dark. It's raining.

ELI SHONBRUN,April,29,1943,"O Heavenly Father, they have crucified an innocent girl and now they are going to crucify an innocent man."
ERNEST WISHON,November,26,1943,"Tell my mother I'm sorry, especially as far as she is concerned. Nothing in my past bothers me as much as the thought of how she will take this. It will be harder on her than it is on me. By my death, the state will gain nothing, while I will gain eternal life."
LOUIS BUCHALTER,March,4,1944,I am anxious to have it clearly understood that I did not offer to talk and give information in exchange for any promise of commutation of my death sentence.
EMANUEL (MENDY) WEISS,March,4,1944,I'm here on a framed-up case. And Governor Dewey knows it. I want to thank Judge Lehman... He knows me because I am a Jew. Give my love to my family.. and everything.

VINCENT CIUCCI,March,23,1962,I have one consolation... when I do take that walk... I know that the Lord knows that I'm speaking the truth. The ones who conspired with their underhanded tactics to obtain their conviction will have to live with it for the rest of their lives.

ELMO PATRICK SONNIER,April,5,1984,"Mr. LeBlanc, I can understand the way you feel. I have no hatred in my heart, and as I leave this world, I ask God to forgive what ... I have done. I ask you to have forgiveness."
ROBERT LEE WILLIE,December,28,1984,"I would just like to say, Mr. and Mrs. Harvey, that I hope you get some relief from my death. Killing people is wrong. That's why you've put me to death. It makes no difference whether it's citizens, countries or governments. Killing is wrong."
CARL SHRINER,June,20,1984,"Many of my friends have mentioned to me to look for the light, but I already saw the light when I accepted Christ as Lord many years ago. Only now I get to go stand in it and enjoy it with the Lord."

JOSEPH CARL SHAW,January,11,1985,"To those who oppose the death penalty in South Carolina, I say continue the fight against the hatred, violence, and revenge of this punitive form of punishment. Killing is wrong when I did it. It is wrong when you do it. I hope you have the courage and the moral strength to stop the killing. I have no bitterness toward anyone. May God bless and forgive you all."
VAN ROOSEVELT SOLOMON,February,20,1985,"Yes, I'd like to say I'd like to give my blessing to all the people that seeked to save my life, and I'd like to curse everyone that seeked to take my life. Farewell."
MARVIN FRANCOIS,May,29,1985,"I am as a grain of sand on the beach of the black race. The black race has lost its pride and dignity and is slowly dying from within and without. My death ends my tears, and the fortune of watching my race slowly die. If there is such a thing as an Antichrist, it ain't one man, but the whole white race."
JEROME BOWDEN,June,24,1986,"I am Jerome Bowden, and I would just like to state that my execution is about to be carried out. And I would like to thank the people at this institution for taking such good care of me in the way that they did. And I hope that by my execution being carried out that it may bring some light to this thing that is wrong. And I would like to have a final prayer with Chaplain [name] if that is possible. Thank you very much."

JEFFREY DAUGHERTY,November,7,1988,"I hope with all my heart I will be the last sacrificial lamb of a system that is not just, and all these people know it is not just. Let's hope there are not many more that have to be sacrificed. The executions serve no purpose.... Some of you look at this as an execution. I look at this as freedom. I've been in prison for 15 years. Now I'm free."
TED BUNDY,January,24,1989,I'd like you to give my love to my family and friends.

WALLACE THOMAS,July,13,1990,"Let my death serve as an instigator that will awaken a nation to fight and adopt the philosophy of the late, great Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who said, ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."""
BUDDY EARL JUSTUS,December,13,1990,"I want it to be over with, not for me, but for the victims' families. I'm ready to go to a better place. I want it to be put to rest. I've asked for forgiveness from a lot of people and I was able to forgive myself.... Let me be the last person.There is a better way to deal with crimes than taking peoples' lives."
ROY ALLEN HARICH,April,24,1991,"I'm disappointed with the almost total lack of fairness in the American criminal justice system. This is truly a sad time in our country's history, when political concerns take on more importance than the fundamental rights of the individual."
ALBERT CLOZZA,July,24,1961,"I cannot change what I have done in the past, no matter how much I wish that I could. Nothing I can say or do will stop the pain that I have caused. I do not expect people to forgive me for what I have done in my life. For I am and have paid for my ways."
ROGER K. COLEMAN,May,20,1992,An innocent man is going to be murdered tonight.When my innocence is proven I hope Americans will recognize the injustice of the death penalty as all other civilized nations have.

DEWITT COOK,January,31,1941,"I am a young man still. To me, life is life whether inside a penitentiary or out. I stand convicted of murder, but in my heart, I am no murderer. Here, surely, is the contingency for which the alternative penalty was planned."
ROBERT E. FOLKES,January,5,1945,I have nothing to say except that I am innocent. It's easier to convict a Negro than a white person. So long everybody
LOUISE PEETE,April,11,1947,"I came from cultured, educated people. I have a background of culture. My parents were not delinquents and they did not rear delinquent children. The Governor is a gentleman-and no gentleman could send a lady to her death. I'm ready. I've been ready for a long time."

LOUIS SMITH,February,8,1957,We might as well have gone in there six years ago.
ROBERT HARMON,August,9,1960,Perhaps my execution will help to do away with capital punishment.

I want to thank my family for standing with me through all this and my attorneys and all the support to me, everybody, the people with this prison department. I appreciated everything-their kindness and everything that they have shown me during these six years."

HENRY M. PORTER,July,9,1985,"I want to thank Father Walsh for his spiritual help. I want to thank Bob Ray [Sanders] and Steve Blow for their friendship. What I want people to know is that they call me a cold-blooded killer when I shot a man that shot me first. The only thing that convicted me was that I am a Mexican and that he was a police officer. People hollered for my life, and they are to have my life tonight. The people never hollered for the life of the policeman that killed a thirteen-year-old boy who was handcuffed in the back seat of a police car.The people never hollered for the life of a Houston police officer who beat up and drowned Jose Campo Torres and threw his body in the river. You call that equal justice. This is your equal justice. This is America's equal justice. A Mexican's life is worth nothing. When a policeman kills someone he gets a suspended sentence or probation. When a Mexican kills a police officer this is what you get. From there you call me a cold-blooded murderer. I didn't tie anyone to a stretcher. I didn't pump any poison into anybody's veins from behind a locked door. You call this justice. I call this and your society a bunch of cold-blooded murderers. I don't say this with any bitterness or anger. I just say this with truthfulness. I hope God forgives me for all my sins. I hope that God will be as merciful to society as he has been to me.

CARLOS DE LUNA,December,7,1989,I want to say I hold no grudges. I hate no one. I love my family. Tell everyone on death row to keep the faith and don't give up.
JAMES SMITH,June,26,1990,"I've already spoken the truth, but because it was spoken by someone accused, the truth was not respected. It must come from the man who spoke the lie. I am not the killer. I myself did not kill anyone. I go to my death without begging for my life. I will not humiliate myself. I will let no man break me. It just can't be done. There is a price to be paid. I want people to wake up to the reality of executions. The price to be paid will be a dear one."

JESSE DEWAYNE JACOBS,January,4,1995,"I have news for you-there is not going to be an execution. This is premeditated murder by the state of Texas. I hope in my death I'm that little bitty snowball that starts to bury the death penalty. I have committed lots of sin in my life but I am not guilty of this crime. I would like to tell my son, daughter and wife that I love them-Eden, if they want proof, give it to them. Thanks for being my friend."

JEFFREY MOTLEY,February,7,1995,"I love you, Mom. Goodbye."
THOMAS GRASSO,March,20,1995,"Mario Cuomo is wright [sic]. Life without parole is much worse than the death penalty. All jurors should remember this. Attica and Oklahoma State Penitentiary are living hells.... I give my life because it is the most precious act of remorse I can make. I hope everyone will treat each other so this act need not be repeated. Words break under this burden. Please tell the media I did not get my SpaghettiOs, I got spaghetti. I want the press to know this."
RICHARD SNELL,April,19,1995,"Governor Tucker, look over your shoulder; justice is coming. I wouldn't trade places with you or any of your cronies. Hell has victories; I am at peace."

KARL HAMMOND,June,21,1995,I just want to say that I know it's so hard for people to lose someone they love so much. I think it's best for me to just say nothing at all.
SYLVESTER ADAMS,August,18,1995,"I am the happiest man in the world. I'm not afraid to die. I'm not crazy. Jesus, your baby is coming home. I love you. I love you, Lord."
WILLIAM GEORGE BONIN,February,23,1996,"That I feel the death penalty is not an answer to the problems at hand. That I feel it sends the wrong message to the youth of the country. Young people act as they see other people acting instead of as people tell them to act. And I would suggest that when a person has thought of doing anything against the law, that before they did, they should go to a quiet place and think about it seriously."
JOE GONZALES,September,18,1999,"There are people all over the world who face things worse than death on a daily basis, and in that sense I consider myself lucky. I cannot find the words to express the sadness I feel for bringing this hurt and pain on my loved ones. I will not ask forgiveness for the decisions I have made in this judicial process, only acceptance. God bless you all."

RICHARD BRIMAGE JR.,February,10,1997,Not from me but I have a message to you from God. Save the children. Find one who needs help and make a small sacrifice of your own wealth and save the innocent ones. They are the key for making the world a better place.
DAVID HERMAN,April,2,1997,"It was horrible and inexcusable for me to take the life of your loved one and to hurt so many mentally and physically. I am here because I took a life and killing is wrong by an individual and by the state, and I am sorry we are here but if my death gives you peace and closure then this is all worthwhile. To all of my friends and family, I love you and I am going home."
KENNETH GENTRY,April,16,1997,"Thank the Lord for the past 14 years that have allowed me to grow as a man. To J.D.'s family, I am sorry for the suffering you have gone through the past 14 years. I hope you can get some peace tonight. To my family, I am happy to be going home to Jesus. Sweet Jesus, here I come. Take me home. I am going your way."
KENNETH RANSOM,October,28,1997,First and foremost I would like to tell the victims' families that I am sorry because I don't feel like I am guilty. I am sorry for the pain all of them have gone through during holidays and birthdays. They are without their loved ones. I have said from the beginning and I will say it again that I am innocent. I did not kill no one. I feel like this is the Lord's will that will be done. I love you all. You know it. Don't cry. Tell my brothers I love them. You all be strong.

You have been so good to me. I love all of you very much. I will see you all when you get there. I will wait for you."
JOSEPH CANNON,April,22,1998,"I am sorry for what I did to your mom. It isn't because I'm going to die. All my life I have been locked up. I could never forgive what I done. I am sorry for all of you. I love you all.Thank you for supporting me. I thank you for being kind to me when I was small. Thank you, God. All right."
FRANK MCFARLAND,April,29,1998,"I owe no apologies for a crime I did not commit. Those who lied and fabricated evidence against me will have to answer for what they have done.

PEDRO MUNIZ,May,19,1998,"I know you can't hear me now but I know that it won't matter what I have to say. I want you to know that I did not kill your sister. If you want to know the truth, and you deserve to know the truth, hire your own investigators. That's all I have to say."
CLIFFORD BOGGESS,June,11,1998,"I'd like to say that for the murders of Ray Hazelwood and Frank Collier, I'm sorry for that pain it has caused you.To my friends, I'd like to say that I love you and I'm glad you've been a part of my life.

I would like to offer up my death for the conversion of sinners on Death Row. Lord Jesus, into your hands I commend my spirit."
THOMAS MARTIN THOMPSON,July,14,1998,For seventeen years the attorney general has been pursuing the wrong man. In time he will come to know this. I don't want anyone to avenge my death. Instead I want you to stop killing people. God bless.
DAVID CASTILLO,August,23,1998,"Keep it brief here. Just want to say, uh, family, take care of yourselves. Uh, look at this as a learning experience. Everything happens for a reason. We all know what really happened, but there are some things you just can't fight. Little people always seem to get squashed. It happens. Even so, just got to take the good with the bad. There is no man that is free from all evil, nor any man that is so evil to be worth nothing. But it's all part of life, and my family, take care of yourselves. Tell my wife I love her. I'll keep an eye on everybody, especially my nieces and nephews. I'm pretty good. I love y'all. Take care. I'm ready."
JAMES RONALD MEANES,December,15,1998,"As the ocean always returns to itself, love always returns to itself. So does consciousness, always returns to itself. And I do so with love on my lips. May God bless all mankind."
MARTIN SAUCEDA VEGA,January,26,1999,"I really don't have much to say. All I want to say is that when the state introduced my sister and my niece as state witnesses, it's not that they testified against me. The thing is, my lawyers would not subpoena anyone, so they allowed the state to subpoena them to paint a picture to the jury that my own sister and niece was testifying against me. Linda is innocent of this. I am innocent of this. Now all you all are seeing in the process a perfect example of ol' freaky deaky Bill Clinton when he signed that antiterrorism law to shorten the appeals. This is a conspiracy. They used false testimony of a woman that said I had raped her, when the test showed that the foreign pubic hair that was found on her body belonged to no one in that room. They found a drop of sposmosa [sic] in the crotch of her pants that was tied to blood type B. My blood type is A. Now the same woman there they brought to testify against this murder case.That woman was under indictment for possession of methamphetamine, delivery of methamphetamine. She could have gotten out of both of those cases. Yet, she swore under oath that she had never been in trouble with the law and none of that mattered. So what does that make this great state? A very high-priced prostitute that sells itself, called justice, to the highest bidder. I am being charged under article 19.83 of the Texas Penal Code of murder with the promise of remuneration. That means they got to have three people, the one that paid, the one that killed, and the deceased. And the alleged remunerator is out on the streets, so how come I'm being executed today, without a remunerator? This is a great American justice. So if you don't think they won't, believe me they will. Ain't no telling who gonna be next. That's all I have to say. Especially for the people of the deceased, Mims is innocent and so am I. So the murder is still not there. Today you are a witness, the state [cough]. Bye."
MANUEL PINA BABBITT,May,4,1999,I forgive all of you.
TYRONE FULLER,July,7,1999,"Yes, to my family, I love you. Please do not mourn my death or my life. Continue to live as I want you to live. I hold no bitterness toward no one. Just remember the light. I'm gonna let this light shine. Let it shine. Let the light shine."

DAVID LONG,December,8,1999,"Ah, just, ah, sorry y'all. I ... tried everything I could to get in touch with y'all to express how sorry I am. I, I never was right after that incident happened. I sent a letter to somebody, you know a letter outlining what I feel about everything. But anyway I just wanted, right after that to apologize to you. I'm real sorry for it. I was raised by the California Youth Authority. I can't really pinpoint where it started, what happened, but really believe that's just the bottom line: what happened to me was in California. I was in their reformatory schools and penitentiary, but they create monsters in there. That's it, I have nothing else to say. Thanks for coming, Jack."
ROBERT ATWORTH,December,14,1999,"Well, first, my people, you guys have heard everything I needed to say today. I hope I said the right things. I hope you heard me. And I hope you go beyond here and do   what you need to do. Do the right thing. Strength in numbers. Look out for each other. You still got a chance with Shawn. Edwin you know what you gotta do. You have my love. It's the right thing. And for everybody else, those people who have malice in their heart, allow ambitions to override what they know. Be right. Even though they just gotta do their job...You've done nothing. I did this; I chose this. You've done nothing. Remember this, if all you know is hatred, if all you know is blood love, you'll never be satisfied. For everybody out there that is like that and knows nothing but negative, kiss my proud white Irish ass. I'm ready warden, send me home."
BILLY HUGHES,January,24,2000,"Yes, I do. I want to tell you all how much I love you all, how much I appreciate everything. I love you all and my family. I treasure every moment that I have had. I want the guys to know out there not to give up, not to give in, that I hope someday the madness in the system, something will come about, something will be resolved. I would gladly trade the last 24 years if it would bring back Mark Frederick. Give him back his life, give back my father his life, and my mother her health. All I ask is that I have one day and all the memories of you and my family and all the things that have happened. They are executing an innocent man because things did not happen as they say they happen...The truth will come out someday. I am not the same person as I was 24 years ago. Who would have thought it would have taken 24 years to get to this moment? Don't give up, don't give in. If I am paying my debt to society, I am due a rebate and a refund, but I love you all and you all watch out for Mom and you all keep up, keep going. Thank you, Warden."
JAMES MORELAND,January,27,2000,"Dad, I love you both. You've been the best. All of you, all of you have truly been the best. And ah, I believe I'm going home. I'm sorry, and I really mean that, it's not just words. My life is all I can give. I stole two lives and I know it was precious to y'all. That's the story of my whole, that's what alcohol will do for you. Oh Jesus, Lord God, take me home. Precious Lord. Take me home Lord. Take me home. Yes, sir. Take me home oh Lord."
TIMOTHY LANE GRIBBLE,March,15,2000,"Okay, thank you. To the Weis family, and ah I just want you to know from the bottom of may heart that I am truly sorry. I mean it, I'm not just saying it. Through the years of being in prison I come to hear and respect our life. It was wrong what I did. I know you had to go through a lot of pain and I'm sorry. To the Jones family, the same is true, I am truly, truly sorry. I wanted to prepare a longer statement but time ran out. I had the chaplain write down a few words for my friends and for you, my family. I would like him to read them for me, and ah, just please find peace."
CHRISTINA RIGGS,May,2,2000,"There is no way no words can express how sorry I am for taking the lives of my babies. Now I can be with my babies, as I always intended. I love you my babies."
MICHAEL LEE MCBRIDE,May,11,2000,"Thank you, um, I anticipated that I would try to memorize and recite beatitudes New Testament, more or less, Luke's beatitudes, I should say, and a, a chapter on love in Ist Corinthians chapter 13, ah, I pretty much knew that I would not be able to memorize so much. There was also a poem that went along with it and in anticipation of not being able to, um, fulfill that desire, I provided a written statement that will be made available to anybody that wants it, I believe. Isn't that correct? So, uh, I wanted you to hear me say that and I apologize and for any other grief I have caused you know, including the, ah, what you're about to witness now. It won't be very long. As soon as you realize that [it will] appear I am falling asleep. I would leave because I won't be here after that point. I will be dead at that point. It's irreversible. God bless all of you. Thank you."
BRIAN ROBERSON,August,9,2000,"Since I have already said all I need to say to all my loved ones, I'm not going to say anything to y'all at this time. Y'all know I love you and y'all know where we're at. I will see y'all when you get there. So this is my statement. To all of the racist white folks in America that hate black folks and to all of the black folks in America that hate themselves: in the infamous words of my famous legendary brother, Nat Turner, ""Y'all kiss my black ass."" Let's do it."
DAVID GIBBS,August,23,2000,"Mr. Bryant, I have wronged you and your family and for that I am truly sorry. I forgive and I have been forgiven. Death is but a brief moment's slumber and a short journey home. I'll see you when you get there. I am done, warden."
WANDA JEAN ALLEN,January,11,2001,"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do."
DENNIS DOWTHITT,March,7,2001,"I am so sorry for what y'all had to go through. I am so sorry for what all of you had to go through. I can't imagine losing two children. If I was y'all, I would have killed me.You know? I am really so sorry about it, I really am. I got to go sister, I love you. Y'all take care and God bless you. Gracie was beautiful and Tiffany was beautiful. You had some lovely girls and I am sorry. I don't know what to say. All right, Warden, let's do it."
JASON MASSEY,April,3,2001,Tonight I dance on the streets of gold. Let those without sin cast the first stone.
JEFFREY DOUGHTIE,August,16,2001,"For almost nine years I have thought about the death penalty, whether it is right or wrong and I don't have any answers. But I don't think the world will be a better or safer place without me. If you had wanted to punish me you would have killed me the day after, instead of killing me now. You are not hurting me now. I have had time to get ready, to tell my family goodbye, to get my life where it needed to be. It started with a needle and it is ending with a needle. Carl, you have been a good friend, man. I am going to look for you. You go back and tell your daughter I love her. Tell her I came in here like a man and I will leave like a man. It's been good, dude. Thank you, Shorty. I appreciate you. I came in like a man and I will leave like a man. I will be with you. I will be with you every time you take a shower. If you leave crying you don't do me justice. If you don't see peace in my eyes you don't see me. I will be the first one you see when you cross over... That is it. Ready, warden."
GERALD MITCHELL,October,22,2001,"Yes, sir. Where's Mr. Marino's mother? Did you get my letter? Just wanted to let you know, I sincerely meant everything I wrote. I am sorry for the pain. I am sorry for the life I took from you. I ask God for forgiveness and I ask you for the same. I know it may be hard, but I'm sorry for what I did. To my family I love each and every one of you. Be strong. Know my love is always with you... always. I know I am going home to be with the Lord. Shed tears of happiness for me. I love each and every one of you. Keep on living. Betty, you have been wonderful. You guided me to the Lord. You have been like a mother to me. Sean, Rusty, Jenny, Marsha, God Bless each and every one of y'all. Jesus, I confess you as my Lord and Savior. I know when I die, I'll have life in heaven and life eternal everlasting. I am ready for that mansion that you promised me."
EMERSON RUDD,November,15,2001,"OK. I guess I'll address the Morgan family. Mrs. Morgan, the sister from the trial. Thirteen or fourteen years ago, I had a non-caring attitude at the time. I'm sorry for shooting your son down at that particular robbery. Politicians say that this brings closure. But my death doesn't bring your son back-it doesn't bring closure. I wish that I could do more, but I can't. I hope this brings you peace. Ursula, Manon, and Irene, I love y'all-take it easy. They've gotta do this thing. I'm still warm from the pepper gas. I love you. I'm ready to go. Call my mom and tell her that this particular process is over. Tell all the brothers to keep their heads up, eyes toward the sky."
VINCENT COOKS,December,12,2001,"Tell my family I love y'all.Watch out for Momma. Don't want to talk too much, I will cry. I'll just cry everywhere. I'm sorry, Teach, for not being a better son and not doing better things. It wasn't your fault. You raised me the way you should; at least I won't be there no more. I miss you, too. I see you there, you doing all right? I sent you a letter. Neckbone, there's a sheet. I got your name on it. Keep on writing, now... You people over there. You know what these people are doing. By them executing me ain't doing nothing right. I don't weigh 180 pounds and 5'7"". Take care, love y'all. Did Roger come up here yet? Tell Pat and them I love them. I'm gonna go ahead and let them do what they're gonna do. Help your sister. See ya later, Pat. Love ya, Becca. Do what you do, warden."
RONALD KEITH SPIVEY,January,24,2002,"If I had a million lives,I couldn't say I'm sorry enough... And what happened in that case changed me so much. I'm not the same person I was 25 years ago... In our society, we hear and say ""What would Jesus do?"" You can believe I don't believe Jesus would do this ... It allows no room for redemption. [The death penalty] dragged the victim's family and my family through living hell. It's incredibly sad that we live in a society that feels it has to kill people."
RANDALL HAFDAHL,January,31,2002,"My last full statement is being released in a way other than me right here. All I want to say, I love you all. Approximately 28 years ago, I remember looking down at a bassinet, I saw an angel. I am looking at her right now. I love you, Colleen. Let's get going.The road goes on forever, and the party never ends. Let's rock and roll. Let's go warden. Me and you, all of us. Remember Wet Willie-keep on smiling, keep on smiling. I love you. It's on the way; I can feel it. It's OK, baby.We have a party to go to. I can feel it now."
JOHNNY JOE MARTINEZ,May,22,2002,"I'm fixing to die, but not for my mistakes. My trial lawyers, they are the ones who are killing me.... I want to thank you [to the victim's mother]. It meant a lot to me. Tell my mother I love her too. I didn't call her because I just couldn't. I am fine. I am happy. See you on the other side."
AILEEN WUORNOS,October,9,2002,"I'd just like to say I'm sailing with the Rock and I'll be back like ""Independence Day"" with Jesus, June 6, like the movie, big mother ship and all. I'll be back."
SAMUEL GALLAMORE,January,14,2003,"There are many things I would like to say, but none more important than how I feel toward Mr. and Mrs. Kenney, and Ms. Arnot. I would like to apologize and say I'm sorry but words seem so hollow and cheap. Their death should not have happened, but it did. I'm so sorry that all of this took place. Now I have devastated my family as well, but my heart has grown in the last few minutes because I was forgiven by the family of Mr. and Mrs. Kenney, and Ms. Arnot. Thank you. You have given me more hope than I have had in a long time. If I could change things I would, not for my sake but for all those who have loved me over the years, and for those who have forgiven me. Thank you for all that you have given me."
GRANVILLE RIDDLE,January,30,2003,"I would just... [speaks in French] I love all of you. I love you Lundy, Levi, my dad. I have no grudges against anyone, or any of the things that have gone wrong. I would like to say to the world, I have always been a nice person. I have never been mean-hearted or cruel. I wish everybody well."
HENRY DUNN JR.,February,6,2003,"To my family and friends... who has always been there for me and done everything in their will and power to help me and stand by my side, I love you dearly, and you will always be in my heart forever. Please continue to struggle and fight against the death penalty, as its only use has been for revenge, and it does not deter crime. It's time for a moratorium in the state of Texas."
BILLY VICKERS,January,28,2004,"Yes. I would just like to say to my family that I am sorry for all the grief I have caused. I love you all. Tell Mama and the kids I love you; I love all of you. And I would like to clear some things up if I could. Tommy Perkins, the man that got a capital life sentence for murdering Kinslow-he did not do it. I did it. He would not even have had anything to do with it if he had known I was going to shoot the man. He would not have gone with me if he had known. I was paid to shoot the man. And Martin, the younger boy, did not know what it was about. He thought it was just a robbery. I am sorry for that. It was nothing personal. I was trying to make a living. A boy on Eastham doing a life sentence for killing Jamie Kent-I did not do it, but I was with his daddy when it was done. I was there with him and down through the years there were several more that I had done or had a part of. And I am sorry and I am not sure how many-there must be a dozen or fourteen, I believe, all total. One I would like to clear up is Cullen Davis-where he was charged with shooting his wife. And all of these it was never nothing personal. It was just something I did to make a living. I am sorry for all the grief I have caused. I love you all. That is all I have to say."
DAVID HARRIS,June,30,2004,"Yes I do. Sir, in honor of a true American hero, ""Let's roll."" Lord Jesus receive my spirit."
DOMINIQUE JEROME GREEN,October,26,2004,There was a lot of people that got me to this point and I can't thank them all. But thank you for your love and support. They have allowed me to do a lot more than I could have on my own.... I have overcame a lot. I am not angry but I am disappointed that I was denied justice. But I am happy that I was afforded you all as family and friends. I love you all. Please just keep the struggle going.... I am just sorry and I am not as strong as I thought I was going to be. But I guess it only hurts for a little while. You are all my family. Please keep my memory alive.
TROY KUNKLE,January,25,2005,"Yes sir. I would like to ask you to forgive me. I made a mistake and I am sorry for what I did. All I can do is ask you to forgive me. I love you and I will see all of you in Heaven. I love you very much. Praise Jesus. I love you. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who have trespassed against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen."
GLEN OCHA,April,5,2005,"I would like to say I apologize to Carol Skjerva, the girl that I murdered, her family and her friends. This is the punishment that I deserve. I'm taking responsibility for my actions. I want everybody to know I'm not a volunteer but this is my responsibility I have to take."
DOUGLAS ROBERTS,April,20,2005,"Yes sir, warden. OK I've been hanging around this Popsicle stand way too long. Before I leave, I want to tell you all. When I die, bury me deep, lay two speakers at my feet, put some headphones on my head and rock and roll me when I'm dead. I'll see you in heaven someday. That's all warden."
KEVIN CONNER,July,27,2005,"Everybody has to die sometime, so... let's get on with the killing."
HERMAN ASHWORTH,September,27,2005,"A life for a life, let it be done and justice will be served."
MARLIN GRAY,October,26,2005,"I go forward now on wings built by the love and support of my family and friends. I go with a peace of mind that comes from never having taken a human life. I forgive those who have hardened their hearts to the truth and I pray they ask forgiveness for they know not what they do. This is not a death, it is a lynching."
DAVID MARK HILL,June,6,2006,"I sincerely apologize to the families of Josie Curry, Michael Gregory, and James Riddle. I am very sorry for the pain that my actions caused to them. Hopefully, my decision to have this sentence carried out, without delay, will help you understand the sincerity of my apology, and will provide you with some closure. To those of you who have expressed forgiveness to me, I thank you. For those of you who have been unable or unwilling to forgive me, I pray that today will provide you with the peace you deserve."
LAMONT REESE,June,20,2006,"I want everyone to know I did not walk to this because this is straight-up murder. I am not going to play a part in my own murder. No one should have to do that...I do not know all of your names and I don't know how you feel about me. And whether you believe it or not, I did not kill them... You have to move past it. It is time to move on."
ANGEL RESENDIZ,June,27,2006,I want to ask if it is in your heart to forgive me. You don't have to. I know I allowed the devil to rule my life. I just ask you to forgive me and ask the Lord to forgive me for allowing the devil to deceive me. I thank God for having patience with me. I don't deserve to cause you pain. You did not deserve this. I deserve what I am getting.
ROCKY BARTON,July,12,2006,I'm sorry for what I done. I'm sorry for killing your mama. I'm not asking you to forgive me. Not a day goes by that I'm not trying to forgive myself. Don't let your anger and hate for me destroy your lives.
ERIC PATTON,August,29,2006,"I want to thank the guards here on death row who have been like family to me, and their lives have been a blessing to me. I've had a good life here on Earth. It's been a blessing. It's been a blast. I want to thank my savior Jesus Christ for all he's done for me. I look forward to being with him now and for eternity."
ANGEL DIAZ,December,13,2006,"The state of Florida is killing an innocent person. The state of Florida is committing a crime, because I am innocent. The death penalty is not only a form of vengeance, but also a cowardly act by humans. I'm sorry for what is happening to me and my family who have been put through this."
JONATHAN MOORE,January,17,2007,"Jennifer, where are you at? I'm sorry, I did not know the man but for a few seconds before I shot him. It was done out of fear, stupidity, and immaturity. It wasn't until I got locked up and saw the newspaper. I saw his face and his smile and I knew he was a good man. I am sorry for all your family and my disrespect-he deserved better. Sorry Gus. I hope all the best for you and your daughters. I hope you have happiness from here on out. Quit the heroin and methadone. I love you dad, Devin, and Walt. We're done warden."
JAMES JACKSON,February,7,2007,"You know, once upon a time diamonds were priceless. I never knew until I ran across my own. I just want Eve to know that. One of these days I'm going to return and get that for myself. Thank you to my family, I love you. Each and every one of you. This is not the end, but the beginning of a new chapter for you and I together forever. I love you all. Remember what I told you Brad. Ms. Irene, God bless you, I love you. See you on the other side.Warden, murder me. Sodom and Gomorrah which is Harris County."
VINCENT GUTIERREZ,March,28,2007,"I do, I would like to tell everybody that I'm sorry about the situation that happened. My bad-everybody is here because of what happened. I'd like to thank everybody that's been here through the years. The little kids overseas-they really changed me. Sister Doris, mom, brothers, sister, dad; I love y'all. My brother... where's my stunt double when you need one? My Lord is my life and savior, nothing shall I fear."
JAMES FILIAGGI,April,24,2007,"When the Browns are in the Super Bowl in the next five years, you'll know I'm up there doing my magic.... I know I flipped some worlds upside down. For me, it's fine, but the state needs to learn this ain't the answer. This is no deterrent to crime. Some are falsely convicted, railroaded. The state needs to wake up. Maybe they will follow the Europeans. God is the only one who knows."
ROBERT COMER,May,22,2007,Go Raiders.
CHRIS NEWTON,May,24,2007,"Yes, boy, I could sure go for some beef stew and a chicken bone. That's it."
PATRICK KNIGHT,June,26,2007,"Yes, I do. I thank the Lord for giving me my friends, for getting me the ones I love. Lord reach down and help innocent men on death row. Lee Taylor needs help, Bobby Hines, Steve Woods. Not all of us are innocent, but those are. Cleve Foster needs help. Melyssa, I love you girl. I know I wasn't going to say anything, but I've got to. Jack, Irene, Danny, Doreen, I love you guys. I said I was going to tell a joke. Death has set me free. That's the biggest joke, I deserve this. And the other joke is I am not Patrick Bryan Knight, and y'all can't stop this execution now. Go ahead, I'm finished. Come on, tell me Lord. I love you Melyssa, take care of that little monster for me."
KARL CHAMBERLAIN,June,11,2008,"I want you all to know, everyone with all my heart, soul, mind and strength. Thank you for being here today to honor Felecia Prechtl, whom I didn't even know. To celebrate my death. My death began on August 2, 1991 and continued when I began to see the beautiful and innocent life that I had taken. I am so terribly sorry. I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am. I have said in interviews, if you want to hurt me and choke me, that's how terrible I felt before this crime. I am sorry, it is her innocence and her life which began the remorse. Every [day] since December 1, 1991, I have embraced life. Thank you for being a part of my life. I love you. May God be with us all. May God have mercy on us all. I am ready. Please do not hate anybody because..."

JOHNNY JOHNSON,February,12,2009,"The Polunsky dungeon should be compared with the death row community as existing, not living. Why do I say this? The death row is full of isolated hearts and suppressed minds. We are filled with love looking for affection and a way to understand. I am a death row resident of the Polunsky dungeon.Why does my heart ache? We want pleasure love and satisfaction.... The walls of darkness crushed in on me. Life without meaning is life without purpose. But the solace within the Polunsky dungeon, the unforgivenness within society, the church pastors and Christians. It is terrifying. Does anyone care or who I am? Can you feel me, people? The Polunsky dungeon is what I call the Pit of Hopelessness. The terrifying thing is the U.S. is the only place, country that is the only civilized country that is free that says it will stop murder and enable justice. I ask each of you to lift up your voices to demand an end to the death penalty. If we live, we live to the Lord. If we die we die to the Lord. Christ rose again, in Jesus' name. Bye Aunt Helen, Luise, Joanna and to all the rest of y'all. You may proceed Warden."
EDWARD NATHANIEL BELL,February,19,2009,"To the Timbrook family, you definitely have the wrong person. The truth will come out one day. This here, killing me, there's no justice about it."

MICHAEL P. DELOZIER,July,2,2009,"I cannot wait to finish paying this debt I owe so I can apologize to the souls of Mr. Morgan and Mr. Bullard, and ask them to forgive me for my taking their lives. To the familiar of my victims all I can say is I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you. I hope my death will bring you some peace."
