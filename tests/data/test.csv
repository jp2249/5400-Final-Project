this execution is not justice this execution is an act of revenge if this is justice then justice is blind take a borderline retarded young male who for the st time ever in his life committed a felony then contaminate his true tell all confession add a judge who discriminates plus an allwhite jury pile on an ineffective assistance of counsel and execute the option of rehabilitation persecute the witnesses and you have created a death sentence for a family lasting over years i will say once againthis execution isnt justice but an act of revenge killing rj will not bring anil back it only justifies an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth its too late to help rj but maybe this poem will help someone else out there seeing through the eyes of a death row inmate sometime i wonder why why he why did he go out into the world to see to be out there and see what really did exist now his name is written down on the death row list i can only imagine how lonesome he was all by himself we both knew he had no future left his hopes and dreams became a fantasy he often said theres nothing left of me i have asked myself why did he get involved with drugs he could never explain why he hung around with thugs did it really make him feel like a king did he actually think he was capable of getting away with anything he knew the thought of life wasnt ticking in his head theres nothing left but the memory of those who lay dead what was did cannot be undone he was confessed he was one of the guilty ones what would he say to the victims family im sorry and my head wasnt on straight i hope you will accept my apology even though its too late i never knew i would take a life and commit a crime i regret it because now i have to face the lethal injection while doing death row time i knew i would pay with struggle and strife but i never thought the cost would be me losing my life richard j wilkerson written through his sister michelle winn,1.0
